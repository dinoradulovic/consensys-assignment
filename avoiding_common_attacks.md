Avoided reentrancy attack.<br/>
Used uint's for all id's and prices inside the Marketplace contract.<br/>
Added modifiers that validate the role of the user.<br/>
Limited functions visibility.<br/>
Implemented emergency stop.<br />

I wish the contracts were more modular, but that would increase the security risk at this point due to my knowledge level.
